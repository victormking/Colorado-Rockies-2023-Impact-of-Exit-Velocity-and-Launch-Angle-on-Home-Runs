# Colorado Rockies 2023: Impact of Exit Velocity and Launch Angle on Home Runs

## Creating visualizations that demonstrate the effect that Exit Velocity and Launch Angle have on Home Runs hit by the MLB Colorado Rockies in 2023 at Home (at Coors) and Away stadiums (not at Coors).

`Colorado Rockies HR ~ Launch Angle + Exit Velocity + Coors.ipynb` Includes code to prepare, analyze, and visualize MLB 2023 Colorado Rockies game data and metrics to investigate their correlation with Home Runs hit at Home (at Coors) and Away stadiums (not at Coors).

`Data` Includes all data files used to carry-out the project.

`Visualizations` Includes various graphical visualizations used to show the relationship between key metrics and Home Runs hit at Home (at Coors) and Away stadiums (not at Coors).

## Pair Plots: Exit Velocity vs Launch Angle (Colorado Rockies 2023)

This visualization combines **density plots and scatterplots** to compare the frequency distributions of exit velocity and launch angle for Colorado Rockies hitters. The downward correlation trend shows that higher launch angles slightly reduce average exit velocity â€” supporting the idea that there's a tradeoff in swing path optimization.
